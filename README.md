# Prominent_Streaks
Discovered prominent streaks on a dataset of boxscores of NBA players in all the games between 1991 to 2004. 
The dataset included a column where all the points scored in each game by the player were listed. 
Each prominent streak is a sequence of points by that player where that streak is not dominated by any other player in the dataset.
